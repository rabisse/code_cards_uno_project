# Creating Uno Stack-App_O

# Task:
Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

# MVP:
Create a simple card game modelled after Uno. The game will involve four suits(colours), with each suit containing the numbers 0 through to 9, adding individual card styling to create visual difference.
This game will exclude any special cards. The game will allow from two to ten players, selected at time of play.

A user should be able to:

1. Add a minimum of two and a maximum of 10 players to the player list.
2. Be able to distinguish different card types from card styling.
3. Be able to play only the cards in their hand that adhere to the rules of the game.
4. Be able to add to their card total by "picking up" cards from the deck.


# Extensions:

1. Addition of special cards, including skips, reversals, pick-up cards and wild cards.
2. Add a victory counter defined by player name. To be displayed in a leader board or chart.
3. Add socket.io to make it playable across multiple computers.
